Overview

Food security means availability,
accessibility and affordability of food to
all people at all times. The poor
households are more vulnerable to food
insecurity whenever there is a problem
of production or distribution of food
crops. Food security depends on the
Public Distribution System (PDS) and
government vigilance and action at
times, when this security is threatened.

What is food security?

Food is as essential for living as air is for
breathing. But food security means
something more than getting two square
meals. Food security has following
dimensions
(a) availability of food means food
production within the country, food
imports and the previous years stock
stored in government granaries.

(b) accessibility means food is within reach

of every person.

(c) affordability implies that an individual
has enough money to buy sufficient,
safe and nutritious food to meet one's
dietary needs.

Thus, food security is ensured in a
country only if (1) enough food is available
for all the persons (2) all persons have
the capacity to buy food of acceptable
quality and (3) there is no barrier on
access to food.

Why food security?

The poorest section of the society might
be food insecure most of the times while
persons above the poverty line might also
be food insecure when the country faces

Food Security in India
Food Security in India

In the 1970s, food security was
understood as the availability at all times
of adequate supply of basic foodstuffs
(UN, 1975). Amartya Sen added a new
dimension to food security and
emphasised the access to food through
what he called entitlements  a
combination of what one can produce,
exchange in the market alongwith state
or other socially provided supplies.

Accordingly, there has been a substantial
shift in the understanding of food security.

The 1995 World Food Summit declared,
Food security at the individual,
household, regional, national and global
levels exists when all people, at all times,
have physical and economic access to
sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet
their dietary needs and food preferences
for an active and healthy life (FAO, 1996,
p.3). The declaration further recognises
that poverty eradication is essential to
improve access to food.

a national disastercalamity like
earthquake, drought, flood, tsunami,
widespread failure of crops causing
famine, etc. How is food security
affected during a calamity? Due to a
natural calamity, say drought, total
production of foodgrains decreases. It
creates a shortage of food in the affected
areas. Due to shortage of food, the prices
goes up. At the high prices, some people
cannot afford to buy food. If such calamity
happens in a very wide spread area or is
stretched over a longer time period, it
may cause a situation of starvation.

A massive starvation might take a turn
of famine.

A Famine is characterised by wide
spread deaths due to starvation and

Rationalised 2023-24 epidemics caused by forced use of
contaminated water or decaying food and
loss of body resistance due to weakening
from starvation.

The most devastating famine that
occurred in India was the FAMINE OF
BENGAL in 1943. This famine killed thirty
lakh people in the province of Bengal.

Nothing like Bengal famine has
happened in India again. It is, however,
disturbing to note that even today, famine
like conditions exist in many parts of the
country, leading to starvation deaths at
times. Natural calamities and pandemics
may also lead to food shortage. For

Who are food-insecure?

Although a large section of people suffer
from food and nutrition insecurity in
India, the worst affected groups are
landless people with little or no land to
depend upon, traditional artisans,
providers of traditional services, petty self-
employed workers and destitutes
including beggars. In the urban areas, the
food insecure families are those whose
working members are generally employed
in ill-paid occupations and casual labour
market. These workers are largely

engaged in seasonal activities and are paid
very low wages that just ensure bare
survival.

Ramu works as a casual labourer
in agriculture in Raipur village. His

also works as a pali to look after the
cattle of the Sarpanch of the village
Satpal Singh. Somu is employed for
the whole year by the Sarpanch and
is paid a sum of Rs 1,000 for this
work. Ramu has three more sons
and two daughters but they are too
young to work on the field. His wife
Sunhari is also (part time) working
as house cleaner for the livestock,
removing and managing cow dung.

able to earn enough either in cash
or kind for him to buy essentials for
two square meals for his family.

However, during the days when he
is unable to get some work, he and
his family really face difficulties and
sometimes his small kids have to
sleep without food. Milk and
vegetables are not a regular part of
meals in the family. Ramu is food

Story of Ahmad

Ahmad is a rickshaw puller in
Bangalore. He has shifted from
Jhumri Taliah along with his 3
brothers, 2 sisters and old parents.

He stays in a jhuggi. The survival of
all members of his family depends on
his daily earnings from pulling
rickshaw. However, he does not have
a secured employment and his
earnings fluctuate every day. During
some days he gets enough earning for
him to save some amount after buying
all his day-to-day necessities. On
other days, he barely earns enough
to buy his daily necessities. However,
fortunately, Ahmad has a yellow card,
which is PDS Card for below poverty
line people. With this card, Ahmad
gets sufficient quantity of wheat, rice,
sugar and kerosene oil for his daily
use. He gets these essentials at half
of the market price. He purchases his
monthly stock during a particular day
when the ration shop is opened for
below poverty people. In this way,
Ahmad is able to eke out his survival
with less than sufficient earnings for
his big family where he is the only
earning member.

from rickshaw-pulling?

How does the yellow card help Ahmad

run his family even with small

The social composition along with the
inability to buy food also plays a role in
food insecurity. The SCs, STs and some
sections of the OBCs (lower castes among
them) who have either poor land-base or
very low land productivity are prone to
food insecurity. The people affected by
natural disasters, who have to migrate to
other areas in search of work, are also
among the most food insecure people. A
high incidence of malnutrition prevails
among women. This is a matter of serious
concern as it puts even the unborn baby
at the risk of malnutrition. A large
proportion of pregnant and nursing
mothers and children under the age of 5
years constitute an important segment of
the food insecure population.

According to the National Health and
Family Survey (NHFS) 199899, the
number of such women and children is
approximately 11 crore.

The

food

insecure people are
disproportionately large in some regions
of the country, such as economically
backward states with high incidence of
poverty, tribal and remote areas, regions
more prone to natural disasters etc. In
fact, the states of Uttar Pradesh (eastern
and south-eastern parts), Bihar,
J harkhand, O rissa, West B engal,
Chattisgarh, parts of Madhya Pradesh and
Maharasthra account for largest number
of food insecure people in the country.

Hunger is another aspect indicating
food insecurity. Hunger is not just an
expression of poverty, it brings about
poverty. The attainment of food security
therefore involves eliminating current
hunger and reducing the risks of future
hunger. Hunger has chronic and seasonal
dimensions. Chronic hunger is a
consequence of diets persistently
inadequate in terms of quantity andor

Food Security in India

45

Rationalised 2023-24 quality. Poor people suffer from chronic
hunger because of their very low income
and in turn inability to buy food even for
survival. Seasonal hunger is related to
cycles of food growing and harvesting. This
is prevalent in rural areas because of the
seasonal nature of agricultural activities
and in urban areas because of casual
labourers, e.g., there is less work for
casual construction labourers during the
rainy season. This type of hunger exists
when a person is unable to get work for
the entire year.

India is aiming at Self-sufficiency in

Foodgrains since Independence.

After Independence, Indian policy-
makers adopted all measures to achieve
self-sufficiency in food grains. India
adopted a new strategy in agriculture,
which resulted in Green Revolution,
especially in the production of wheat
and rice.

Indira Gandhi, the then Prime Minister
of India, officially recorded the impressive
strides of Green Revolution in agriculture
by releasing a special stamp entitled
Wheat Revolution in July 1968. The

success of wheat was later replicated in
rice. The increase in foodgrains was,
however, disproportionate. The highest rate
of growth was achieved in Uttar Pradesh
and Madhya Pradesh, which was 44.01 and
30.21 million tonnes in 201516. The total
foodgrain production was 252.22 Million
tonnes in 201516 and it has changed to
275.68 million tonnes in 201617.

Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh
recorded a significant production in field
of wheat which was 26.87 and 17.69
million tonnes in 201516, respectively.

West Bengal and UP, on the other hand,
recorded significant production of rice 15.75
and 12.51 Million tonnes in 201516
respectively.

level has further been ensured with a
carefully designed food security system by
the government. This system has two
components: (a) buffer stock, and (b) public
distribution system.

What is Buffer stock?

Buffer Stock is the stock of foodgrains,
namely wheat and rice, procured by the
government
through
Food
Corporation of India (FCI). The FCI
purchases wheat and rice from the
farmers in states where there is surplus
production. The farmers are paid a pre-

the

announced price for their crops. This
price is called Minimum Support Price
(MSP). The MSP is declared by the
government every year before the sowing
season to provide incentives to farmers
for raising the production of these crops.

The purchased foodgrains are stored in

---
#### granaries. Do you know why this buffer

---

stock is created by the government? This
is done to distribute foodgrains in the
deficit areas and among the poorer
strata of the society at a price lower than
the market price also known as Issue
Price. This also helps resolve the
problem of shortage of food during
adverse weather conditions or during the
periods of calamity.

What is the Public Distribution
System?

The food procured by the FCI is distributed
through government regulated ration
shops among the poorer section of the
society. This is called the Public
Distribution System (PDS). Ration shops
are now present in most localities,

47

Rationalised 2023-24

villages, towns and cities. There are
about 5.5 lakh ration shops all over the
country. Ration shops also, known as
Fair Price Shops, keep stock of
foodgrains, sugar, and kerosene for
cooking. These items are sold to people
at a price lower than the market price.

Any family with a ration card can buy a
stipulated amount of these items (e.g. 35
kg of grains, 5 litres of kerosene, 5 kgs of
sugar etc.) every month from the nearby
ration shop.

There are three kinds of ration cards: (a)
Antyodaya cards for the poorest of the poor;
(b) BPL cards for those below poverty line;
and (c) APL cards for all others.

programmes

The introduction of Rationing in India
dates back to the 1940s against the
backdrop of the Bengal famine. The
rationing system was revived in the wake
of an acute food shortage during the
1960s, prior to the Green Revolution. In
the wake of the high incidence of poverty
levels, as reported by the NSSO in the
food
mid-1970s,
were

introduced: Public Distribution System
(PDS) for food grains (in existence earlier
but strengthened thereafter); Integrated
Child Development Services (ICDS)
(introduced in 1975 on an experimental
basis) and Food-for -Work
(FFW)
(introduced in 197778). Over the years,
several new programmes have been
launched and some have been
restructured with the growing experience
of administering the programmes. At
present, there are several Poverty
Alleviation Programmes (PAPs), mostly in
rural areas, which have an explicit food
component also. While some of the
programmes such as PDS, mid-day meals
etc. are exclusively food security
programmes, most of the PAPs also
enhance food security. Employment
programmes greatly contribute to food
security by increasing the income of
the poor.

Current Status of Public the
Distribution System

Public Distribution System (PDS) is the
most important step taken by the
Government of India (GoI) towards
ensuring food security. In the beginning,

the coverage of PDS was universal with
no discrimination between the poor and
the non-poor. Over the years, the policy
related to PDS has been revised to make
it more efficient and targeted. In 1992,
Revamped Public Distribution System
(RPDS) was introducted in 1,700 blocks
in the country. The target was to provide

Rationalised 2023-24 of poorest of the poor and indigent senior
citizens, respectively. The functioning of
these two schemes was linked with the
existing network of the PDS.

Some important features of PDS are

summarised in Table 4.3.

The PDS has proved to be the most
effective instrument of government policy
over the years in stabilising prices and
making food available to consumers at
affordable prices. It has been instrumental
in averting widespread hunger and famine
by supplying food from surplus regions of
the country to the deficit ones. In addition,
the prices have been under revision in favour
of poor households in general. The system,
including the minimum support price and
procurement has contributed to an increase
in foodgrain production and provided income
security to farmers in certain regions.

However, the Public Distribution
System has faced severe criticism on
several grounds. Instances of hunger are
prevalent despite overflowing granaries.

FCI godowns are overflowing with grains,
with some rotting away and some being
eaten by rats. Graph 4.2 shows the

difference in foodgrain stocks in Central
pool and its stocking norms.

Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY)

AAY was launched in December 2000.

Under this scheme one crore of the
poorest among the BPL families
covered under the targeted public
distribution system were identified.

Poor families were identified by the
respective state rural development
departments through a Below Poverty
Line (BPL) survey. Twenty-five
kilograms of foodgrains were made
available to each eligible family at a
highly subsidised rate of  2 per kg
for wheat and  3 per kg for rice. This
quantity has been enhanced from 25
to 35 kg with effect from April 2002.

The scheme has been further
expanded twice by additional 50 lakh
BPL families in June 2003 and in
August 2004. With this increase, 2
crore families have been covered
under the AAY.

The rising Minimum Support Prices
(MSP) have raised the maintenance
cost of procuring foodgrains by the
government. Rising transportation
and storage costs of the FCI are other
contributing factors in this increase.

Food Security in India

51

Rationalised 2023-24 As per the NSSO report No. 558 in rural
India, the per person per month
consumption of rice has declined from 6.38
Kg. in 2004-05 to 5.98 Kg in 2011-12. In
urban India, the per person per month
consumption of rice, too has declined from

### 4.71 Kg in 2004-05 to 4.49 Kg in 2011-12.

Per Capita consumption of PDS rice has
doubled in rural India and increased by
66 in urban India since 2004-05. The per
Capita consumption of PDS wheat has
doubled since 2004-05 in both rural and
urban India.

PDS dealers are sometimes found
resorting to malpractices like diverting
the grains to open market to get better
margin, selling poor quality grains at
ration shops, irregular opening of the
shops, etc. It is common to find that ration
shops regularly have unsold stocks of poor
quality grains left. This has proved to be
a big problem. When ration shops are
unable to sell, a massive stock of
foodgrains piles up with the FCI. In recent
years, there is another factor that has
led to the decline of the PDS. Earlier every
family, poor and non-poor had a ration
card with a fixed quota of items such as
rice, wheat, sugar etc. These were sold
at the same low price to every family. The
three types of cards and the range of
prices that you see today did not exist. A
large number of families could buy
foodgrains from the ration shops subject
to a fixed quota. These included low
income families whose incomes were
marginally higher than the below poverty
line families. Now, with TPDS of three
different prices, any family above the
poverty line gets very little discount at
the ration shop. The price for APL family

is almost as high as open market price,
so there is little incentive for them to buy
these items from the ration shop.

Role of cooperatives in food security

c o n t r o l l e d

The cooperatives are also playing an
important role in food security in India
especially in the southern and western
parts of the country. The cooperative
societies set up shops to sell low priced
goods to poor people. For example, out
of all fair price shops running in Tamil
Nadu, around 94 per cent are being run
by the cooperatives. In Delhi, Mother
Dairy is making strides in provision of
milk and vegetables to the consumers

Government of Delhi. Amul is another
success story of cooperatives in milk
and milk products from Gujarat. It has
brought about the White Revolution in
the country. These are a few examples
of many more cooperatives running in
different parts of the country ensuring

of society.

Similarly, in Maharashtra, Academy of
Development Science
(ADS) has
facilitated a network of NGOs for setting
up grain banks in different regions. ADS
organises training and capacity building
programmes on food security for NGOs.

Grain Banks are now slowly taking shape
in different parts of Maharashtra. ADS
efforts to set up Grain Banks, to facilitate
replication through other NGOs and to
influence the Governments policy on food
security are thus paying rich dividends.

The ADS Grain Bank programme is
acknowledged as a successful and
innovative food security intervention.

Rationalised 2023-24 Summary

Food security of a nation is ensured if all of its citizens have enough nutritious food
available, all persons have the capacity to buy food of acceptable quality and there
is no barrier on access to food. The people living below the poverty line might be food
insecure all the time while better off people might also turn food insecure due to
calamity or disaster. Although a large section of people suffer from food and nutrition
insecurity in India, the worst affected groups are landless or land poor households
in rural areas and people employed in ill paid occupations and casual labourers
engaged in seasonal activities in the urban areas. The food insecure people are
disproportionately large in some regions of the country, such as economically
backward states with high incidence of poverty, tribal and remote areas, regions
more prone to natural disasters etc. To ensure availability of food to all sections of
the society the Indian government carefully designed food security system, which is
composed of two components: (a) buffer stock and (b) public distribution system. In
addition to PDS, various poverty alleviation programmes were also started which
comprised a component of food security. Some of these programmes are: Integrated
Child Development Services (ICDS); Food-for-Work (FFW); Mid-Day Meals; Antyodaya
A nna Yojana (A AY) etc. In addition to the role of the government in ensuring food
security, there are various cooperatives and NGOs also working intensively towards
this direction.
