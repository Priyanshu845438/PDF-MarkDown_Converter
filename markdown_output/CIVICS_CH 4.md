Working of
Institutions

OVERVIEW

Democracy is not just about people electing their rulers. In a democracy
the rulers have to follow some rules and procedures. They have to work
with and within institutions. This chapter is about the working of such
institutions in a democracy. We try to understand this by looking at the
manner in which major decisions are taken and implemented in our
country. We also look at how disputes regarding these decisions are
resolved. In this process we come across three institutions that play a key
role in major decisions  legislature, executive and judiciary.

You have already read something about these institutions in earlier
classes. Here we shall quickly summarise those and move on to asking

---
#### larger questions. In the case of each institution we ask: What does this

---

institution do? How is this institution connected to other institutions?

What makes its functioning more or less democratic? The basic objective
here is to understand how all these institutions together carry on the
work of government. Sometimes we compare these with similar institutions
in other democracies. In this chapter we take our examples from the
working of the national level government called Central Government, Union
Government, or just Government of India. While reading this chapter, you

policy decision. It said that 27 per
cent of the vacancies in civil posts
and services under the Government
of India are reserved for the Socially
and Educationally Backward Classes
(SEBC). SEBC is another name for all
those people who belong to castes
that are considered backward by the
government. The benefit of job res-
ervation was till then available only
to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes. Now a new third category
called SEBC was introduced. Only
persons who belong to backward
classes were eligible for this quota
of 27 per cent jobs. Others could not
compete for these jobs.

Who decided
this
Memorandum? Clearly, such a big
decision could not have been taken
by the person who signed that
document. The officer was merely
implementing the instructions given
by the Minister of Personnel, Public
Grievances and Pensions, of which
the Department was a part. We can
guess that such a major decision
would have involved other major
functionaries in our country. You
have already read in the previous
class about some of them. Let us go
over some of the main points that
you covered then:
President is the head of the state
and is the highest formal authority
in the country.

Prime Minister is the head of the

Parliament consists of the
President and two Houses, Lok

a majority of Lok Sabha members.

So, were all these people involved
in this decision regarding the Office

This Office Memorandum was the
culmination of a long chain of
events. The Government of India had
appointed the Second Backward
Classes Commission in 1979. It was
headed by B.P. Mandal. Hence it was
popularly called the Mandal
Commission. It was asked to
determine the criteria to identify the
socially and educationally backward
classes in India and recommend
steps to be taken for their
advancement. The Commission gave
its Report in 1980 and made many
recommendations. One of these was
that 27 per cent of government jobs
be reserved for the socially and
educationally backward classes.

Mandal Commission report. The

GCMMF India

The President of India in his
address to the Parliament
announced the intention of the
government to implement the
recommendations of the Mandal
Commission.

On 6 August 1990, the Union
Cabinet took a formal decision to
implement the recommendations.

Next day Prime Minister V.P. Singh
informed the Parliament about
this decision through a statement
in both the Houses of Parliament.

The decision of the Cabinet was
sent to the Department of Personnel
and Training. The senior officers of
the Department drafted an order in
line with the Cabinet decision and
took the ministers approval. An
officer signed the order on behalf of
the Union Government. This was
how O.M. No. 36012 3190 was
born on 13 August 1990.

For the next few months, this was
the most hotly debated issue in the
country. Newspapers and magazines

were full of different views and
opinions on this issue. It led to
widespread protests and counter-
protests, some of which were violent.

People reacted strongly because this
decision affected thousands of job
opportunities. Some felt that
existence of inequalities among
people of different castes in India
necessitated job reservations. They
felt, this would give a fair
opportunity to those communities
who so far had not adequately been
represented

Others felt that this was unfair as
it would deny equality of opportunity
to those who did not belong to
backward communities. They would
be denied jobs even though they
could be more qualified. Some felt
that this would perpetuate caste
feelings among people and hamper
national unity. In this chapter we

Who resolved this dispute? You
know that the Supreme Court and the
High Courts in India settle disputes
arising out of governmental decisions.

Some persons and associations
opposed to this order filed a number
of cases in the courts. They appealed
to the courts to declare the order
invalid and stop its implementation.

The Supreme Court of India bunched
all these cases together. This case was
known as the Indira Sawhney and
others Vs Union of India case. Eleven
judges of the Supreme Court heard
arguments of both sides. By a
majority, the Supreme Court judges
in 1992 declared that this order of the
Government of India was valid. At
the same time the Supreme Court
asked the government to modify its

We have seen one example of how
the government works. Governing a
country involves various such
activities. For example,
the
government is responsible for
ensuring security to the citizens and
providing facilities for education
and health to all. It collects taxes
and spends the money thus raised
on administration, defence and
development programmes.

It
formulates and implements several
welfare schemes. Some persons have
to take decisions on how to go about
these activities. Others have to
implement these decisions. If
disputes arise on these decisions or
in their implementation, there should
be someone to determine what is
right and what is wrong. It is
important that everyone should
know who is responsible for doing
what. It is also important that these
activities keep taking place even if
the persons in key positions change.

So, to attend to all these tasks,
several arrangements are made in
all modern democracies. Such
arrangements are called institutions.

A democracy works well when these
institutions perform functions
assigned to them. The Constitution
of any country lays down basic
rules on the powers and functions

of each institution. In the example
above, we saw several such
institutions at work.

The Prime Minister and the
Cabinet are institutions that take
all important policy decisions.

The Civil Servants, working
together, are responsible for
taking steps to implement the
ministers decisions.

Supreme Court is an institution
where disputes between citizens
and the government are finally
settled.

Can you think of some other insti-
tutions in this example? What is
their role?

Working with institutions is not
easy. Institutions involve rules and
regulations. This can bind the hands
of leaders. Institutions involve
meetings, committees and routines.

This often leads to delays and
complications. Therefore dealing
with institutions can be frustrating.

One might feel that it is much better
to have one person take all decisions
without any rules, procedures and
meetings. But that is not the spirit
of democracy. Some of the delays
and complications introduced by
institutions are very useful. They
provide an opportunity for a wider
set of people to be consulted in any
decision. Institutions make it

Since Parliament plays a central
role in modern democracies, most
large countries divide the role and
powers of Parliament in two parts.

They are called Chambers or
Houses. One House is usually
directly elected by the people and

---

of the people. The second House is
usually elected indirectly and
performs some special functions.

The most common work for the
second House is to look after the
interests of various states, regions
or federal units.

In our country, Parliament
consists of two Houses. The two
Houses are known as the Council of
States (Rajya Sabha) and the House
of the People (Lok Sabha). The
President of India is a part of
Parliament, although she is not a
member of either House. That is why
all laws made in the Houses come
into force only after they receive the
assent of the President.

You have read about the Indian
Parliament in earlier classes. From
the Chapter 3 you know how Lok
Sabha elections take place. Let us
recall some key differences between
the composition of these two Houses
of Parliament. Answer the following
for the Lok Sabha and the Rajya
Sabha:
What is the total number of

members?

Who elects the members?

What is the length of the term (in

years)?

Can the House be dissolved or is

it permanent?

Which of the two Houses is more
powerful? It might appear that the
Rajya Sabha is more powerful, for
sometimes it is called the Upper
Chamber and the Lok Sabha the
Lower Chamber. But this does not
mean that Rajya Sabha is more
powerful than Lok Sabha. This is
just an old style of speaking and not
the

Our Constitution does give the
Rajya Sabha some special powers

power. Let us see how:
1 Any ordinary law needs to be
passed by both the Houses. But if
there is a difference between the
two Houses, the final decision is
taken in a joint session in which
members of both the Houses sit
together. Because of the larger
number of members, the view of
the Lok Sabha is likely to prevail
in such a meeting.

---
#### 2 Lok Sabha exercises more powers

---

in money matters. Once the Lok
Sabha passes the budget of the
government or any other money
related law, the Rajya Sabha
cannot reject it. The Rajya Sabha
can only delay it by 14 days or
suggest changes in it. The Lok
Sabha may or may not accept
these changes.

When Parliament is in session, there is a special
programme everyday on Doordarshan about the
proceedings in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. Watch

say they have no confidence in the
Council of Ministers, all ministers

to quit. The Rajya Sabha does not
have this power.

that the person who signed the

policy decision taken by someone
else. We noted the role of the Prime
Minister in taking that decision. But
we also know that he could not
have taken that decision if he did
not have support from the Lok Sabha.

In that sense he was only executing
the wishes of the Parliament.

Thus, at different levels of any
government we find functionaries
who take day-to-day decisions but

#### do not exercise supreme power on

behalf of the people. All those
functionaries are collectively known
as the executive. They are called
executive because they are in charge
of the execution of the policies of
the government. Thus, when we talk
about the government we usually
mean the executive.

In a democratic country, two
categories make up the executive.

One that is elected by the people for
a specific period, is called the
political executive. Political leaders
who take the big decisions fall in this
category. In the second category,
people are appointed on a long-term
basis. This is called the permanent
executive or civil services. Persons
working in civil services are called
civil servants. They remain in office
even when the ruling party changes.

These officers work under political
executive and assist them in
carrying out the day-to-day
administration. Can you recall the
role of political and non-political

executive in the case of the Office
Memorandum?

You might ask: Why does the
political executive have more power
than the non-political executive?

Why is the minister more powerful
than the civil servant? The civil
servant is usually more educated
and has more expert knowledge of
the subject. The advisors working in
the Finance Ministry know more
about economics than the Finance
Minister. Sometimes the ministers
may know very little about the
technical matters that come under
their ministry. This could easily
happen in ministries like Defence,
Industry, Health, Science and
Technology, Mines, etc. Why should
the minister have the final say on
these matters?

The reason is very simple. In a
democracy the will of the people is
supreme. The minister is an elected
representative of the people and

---
#### thus empowered to exercise the will

---

of the people on their behalf. She is
finally answerable to the people for
all the consequences of her
decision. That is why the minister
takes all the final decisions. The
minister decides the overall
framework and objectives in which
decisions on policy should be
made. The minister is not, and is not
expected to be, an expert in the
matters of her ministry. The
minister takes the advice of experts
on all technical matters. But very
often experts hold different opinions
or place before her more than one
option. Depending on what the
overall objective is, the minister
decides.

Actually this happens in any large
organisation. Those who understand
the overall picture take the most

After the appointment of the Prime
Minister, the President appoints
other ministers on the advice of the
Prime Minister. The Ministers are
usually from the party or the
coalition that has the majority in the
Lok Sabha. The Prime Minister is
free to choose ministers, as long as
they are members of Parliament.

Sometimes, a person who is not a
member of Parliament can also
become a minister. But such a
person has to get elected to one of
the Houses of Parliament within six
months of appointment as minister.

Council of Ministers is the official
name for the body that includes all
the Ministers. It usually has 60 to
80 Ministers of different ranks.

Cabinet Ministers are usually top-
level leaders of the ruling party or
parties who are in charge of the
major ministries. Usually the
Cabinet Ministers meet to take
decisions in the name of the
Council of Ministers. Cabinet is
thus the inner ring of the Council
of Ministers. It comprises about 25
ministers.

Ministers of State with indepen-
dent charge are usually in-charge
of smaller Ministries. They
participate in the Cabinet meet-
ings only when specially invited.

Ministers of State are attached to
and required to assist Cabinet
Ministers.

why parliamentary democracy in

No minister can openly criticise
any decision of the government,
even if it is about another Ministry
or Department. Every ministry has
secretaries, who are civil servants.

The secretaries provide
the
necessary background information
to the ministers to take decisions.

The Cabinet as a team is assisted
by the Cabinet Secretariat. This
includes many senior civil servants
who try to coordinate the working of
different ministries.

the extent of power wielded by a
Prime Minister also depends on the

that position.

However, in recent years the rise
of coalition politics has imposed
certain constraints on the power of
the Prime Minister. The Prime

Minister of a coalition government
cannot take decisions as he likes.

He has to accommodate different
groups and factions in his party as

also has to heed to the views and
positions of the coalition partners
and other parties, on whose support
the survival of the government

only nominal powers. The President of
India is like the Queen of Britain whose
functions are to a large extent
ceremonial. The President supervises
the overall functioning of all the political
institutions in the country so that they
operate in harmony to achieve the
objectives of the State.

The President is not elected directly
by the people. The elected Members
of Parliament (MPs) and the elected
the Legislative
Members of
Assemblies (MLAs) elect her. A
candidate standing for Presidents
post has to get a majority of votes to
win the election. This ensures that
the President can be seen to represent
the entire nation. At the same time
the President can never claim the kind
of direct popular mandate that the
Prime Minister can. This ensures that
she remains only a nominal executive.

The same is true of the powers of
the President. If you casually read
the Constitution you would think
that there is nothing that she cannot
do. All governmental activities take
place in the name of the President.

All laws and major policy decisions
of the government are issued in her
name. All major appointments are
made in the name of the President.

These include the appointment of

only on the advice of the Council of
Ministers. The President can ask the
Council of Ministers to reconsider its
advice. But if the same advice is
given again, she is bound to act
according to it. Similarly, a bill
passed by the Parliament becomes
a law only after the President gives
assent to it. If the President wants,
she can delay this for some time and
send the bill back to Parliament for
reconsideration. But if Parliament
passes the bill again, she has to
sign it.

So you may wonder what does the
President really do? Can she do
anything on her own at all? There is
one very important thing she should
do on her own: appoint the Prime
Minister. When a party or coalition
of parties secures a clear majority
in the elections, the President, has
to appoint the leader of the majority
party or the coalition that enjoys
majority support in the Lok Sabha.

When no party or coalition gets a
majority in the Lok Sabha, the

The President appoints a leader who
in her opinion can muster majority
support in the Lok Sabha. In such a
case, the President can ask the

Sabha within a specified time.

The Presidential System

Presidents all over the world are not always nomi-
nal executives like the President of India. In many
countries of the world, the President is both the
head of the state and the head of the government.

The President of the United States of America is
the most well known example of this kind of Presi-
dent. The US President is directly elected by the
people. He personally chooses and appoints all
Ministers. The law making is still done by the leg-
islature (called the Congress in the US), but the
president can veto any law. Most importantly, the
president does not need the support of the major-
ity of members in the Congress and neither is he
answerable to them. He has a fixed tenure of four
years and completes it even if his party does not
have a majority in the Congress.

This model is followed in most of the countries
of Latin America and many of the ex-Soviet Union
countries. Given the centrality of the President,
this system of government is called the Presiden-
tial form of government. In countries like ours that
follow the British model, the parliament is su-
preme. Therefore our system is called the parlia-
mentary system of government.

Follow the news about any major court case in a
High Court or the Supreme Court. What was the
original verdict? Did the High Court or the
Supreme Court change it? What was the reason?

This is why an independent and
powerful judiciary is considered
essential for democracies. All the
courts at different levels in a country
put together are called the judiciary.

The Indian judiciary consists of a
Supreme Court for the entire nation,
High Courts in the states, District
Courts and the courts at local level.

India has an integrated judiciary. It
means the Supreme Court controls
the judicial administration in the
country. Its decisions are binding on
all other courts of the country. It can
take up any dispute
Between citizens of the country;
Between citizens and government;
Between two or more state

governments; and

Between governments at the union

and state level.

It is the highest court of appeal in
civil and criminal cases. It can hear
appeals against the decisions of the
High Courts.

Independence of the judiciary
means that it is not under the
control of the legislature or the
executive. The judges do not act on
the direction of the government or
according to the wishes of the party
in power. That is why all modern
democracies have courts that are
independent of the legislature and
the executive. India has achieved
this. The judges of the Supreme
Court and the High Courts are
appointed by the President on the
advice of the Prime Minister and in

consultation with the Chief Justice
of the Supreme Court. In practice it
now means that the senior judges
of the Supreme Court select the new
judges of the Supreme Court and the
High Courts. There is very little scope
for interference by the political
executive. The senior most judge of
the Supreme Court is usually
appointed the Chief Justice. Once
a person is appointed as judge of the
Supreme Court or the High Court it
is nearly impossible to remove him
or her from that position. It is as
difficult as removing the President
of India. A judge can be removed
only by an impeachment motion
passed separately by two-thirds
members of the two Houses of the
Parliament. It has never happened
in the history of Indian democracy.

The judiciary in India is also one
of the most powerful in the world.

The Supreme Court and the High
Courts have the power to interpret
the Constitution of the country. They
can declare invalid any law of the
legislature or the actions of the
executive, whether at the Union
level or at the state level, if they find
such a law or action is against the

Constitution. Thus they can
determine the Constitutional
validity of any legislation or action
of the executive in the country,
when it is challenged before them.

This is known as the judicial review.

The Supreme Court of India has also
ruled that the core or basic
principles of the Constitution cannot
be changed by the Parliament.

The powers and the independence
of the Indian judiciary allow it to act
as the guardian of the Fundamental
Rights. We shall see in the next
chapter that the citizens have a
right to approach the courts to seek
remedy in case of any violation of
their rights. In recent years the
Courts have given several
judgments and directives to protect
public interest and human rights.

Any one can approach the courts if
public interest is hurt by the actions
of government. This is called public
interest litigation. The courts
intervene to prevent the misuse of
the governments power to make
decisions. They check malpractices
on the part of public officials. That is
why the judiciary enjoys a high level
of confidence among the people.

DEMOCRATIC
RIGHTS

OVERVIEW

In the previous two chapters we have looked at two major elements of a
democratic government. In Chapter 3 we saw how a democratic
government has to be periodically elected by the people in a free and fair
manner. In Chapter 4 we learnt that a democracy must be based on
institutions that follow certain rules and procedures. These elements are
necessary but not sufficient for a democracy. Elections and institutions
need to be combined with a third element  enjoyment of rights  to make
a government democratic. Even the most properly elected rulers working
through the established institutional process must learn not to cross some
limits. Citizens democratic rights set those limits in a democracy.

This is what we take up in this final chapter of the book. We begin by

About 600 people were secretly
picked up by the US forces from all
over the world and put in a prison
in Guantanamo Bay, an area near
Cuba controlled by Amercian Navy.

Anass father, Jamil El-Banna, was
among them. The American
government said that they were
enemies of the US and linked to the
attack on New York on 11
September 2001. In most cases the
governments of their countries were
not asked or even informed about
their imprisonment. Like other
prisoners, El-Bannas family got to
know that he was in that prison only
through the media. Families of
prisoners, media or even UN
representatives were not allowed to
meet them. The US army arrested
them, interrogated them and
decided whether to keep them there
or not. There was no trial before any
magistrate in the US. Nor could
these prisoners approach courts in
their own country.

were being denied the treatment

prisoners had tried protesting against
these conditions by going on a hunger

even after they were officially declared
not guilty. An independent inquiry
by the UN supported these findings.

The UN Secretary General said the
prison in Guantanamo Bay should be
closed down. The US government
refused to accept these pleas.

The case of Guantanamo Bay looks
like an exception, for it involves the
government of one country denying
rights to citizens of another country.

Let us therefore look at the case of
Saudi Arabia and the position of the
citizens with regard to their
government. Consider these facts:
The country is ruled by a
hereditary king and the people
have no role in electing or
changing their rulers.

The king selects the legislature as
well as the executive. He appoints
the judges and can change any of
their decisions.

Citizens cannot form political par-
ties or any political organisations.

Media cannot report anything that
the monarch does not like.

There is no freedom of religion.

Every citizen is required to be
Muslim. Non-Muslim residents
can follow their religion in private,
but not in public.

Women are subjected to many
public restrictions. The testimony
of one man is considered equal to
that of two women.

This is true not just of Saudi
Arabia. There are many countries in
the world where several of these
conditions exist.

You might think that this is possible

Kosovo. This was a province of
Yugoslavia before its split. In this
province the population was
overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian.

But in the entire country, Serbs
were in majority. A narrow minded
Serb
nationalist Milosevic
(pronounced Miloshevich) had won
the election. His government was
very hostile to the Kosovo
Albanians. He wanted the Serbs to
dominate the country. Many Serb
leaders thought that Ethnic
minorities like Albanians should
either leave the country or accept
the dominance of the Serbs.

This is what happened to an
Albanian family in a town in Kosovo
in April 1999:

74-year-old Batisha Hoxha was
sitting in her kitchen with her 77-
yearold husband, Izet, staying
warm by the stove. They had heard
explosions but did not realise that
Serbian troops had already entered
the town. The next thing she knew,
five or six soldiers had burst through
the front door and were demanding

You would perhaps desire a

no one should be arrested without
proper reason and information. And
if someone is arrested, he or she
should have a fair chance to defend
themselves. You might agree that
such assurance cannot apply to

everything. One has to be reasonable

Rationalised 2023-24 want to live happily, without fear
and without being subjected to
degraded treatment. For this we
expect others to behave in such a
way that does not harm us or hurt
us. Equally, our actions should not
also harm or hurt others. So a right
is possible when you make a claim
that is equally possible for others.

You cannot have a right that harms
or hurts others. You cannot have a
right to play a game in such a way
that it breaks the neighbours
window. The Serbs in Yugoslavia
could not have claimed the whole
country for themselves. The claims
we make should be reasonable.

They should be such that can be
made available to others in an equal
measure. Thus, a right comes with
an obligation to respect other rights.

Just because we claim some thing
it does not become our right. It has
to be recognised by the society we
live in. Rights acquire meaning only
in society. Every society makes
certain rules to regulate our
conduct. They tell us what is right
and what is wrong. What is
recognised by the society as rightful
becomes the basis of rights. That is
why the notion of rights changes
from time to time and society to
society. Two hundred years ago
anyone who said that women should
have right to vote would have
sounded strange. Today not granting
them vote in Saudi Arabia appears
strange.

When the socially recognised
claims are written into law they
acquire real force. Otherwise they
remain merely as natural or moral
in
rights.

Guantanamo Bay had a moral claim
not to be tortured or humiliated. But
they could not go to anyone to
enforce this claim. When law

their application. When fellow
citizens or the government do not
respect these rights we call it
violation or infringement of our
rights. In such circumstances
citizens can approach courts to
protect their rights. So, if we want
to call any claim a right, it has to
have these three qualities. Rights
are reasonable claims of persons
recognised by society and
sanctioned by law.

Rights are necessary for the very
sustenance of a democracy. In a
democracy every citizen has to have
the right to vote and the right to
be elected to government. For
democratic elections to take place, it
is necessary that citizens should
have the right to express their
opinion, form political parties and
take part in political activities.

Rights also perform a very special
role in a democracy. Rights protect
minorities from the oppression of
majority. They ensure that the
majority cannot do whatever it likes.

Rights are guarantees which can be
used when things go wrong. Things
may go wrong when some citizens
may wish to take away the rights of
others. This usually happens when
those in majority want to dominate
those in minority. The government
should protect the citizens rights in
such a situation. But sometimes
elected governments may not
protect or may even attack the rights
of their own citizens. That is why
some rights need to be placed higher
than the government, so that the
government cannot violate them. In
most democracies the basic rights
of the citizen are written down in the
constitution.

### 5.3 RIGHTS IN THE INDIAN CONSTITUTION

In
like most other
democracies in the world, these
rights are mentioned in the
Constitution. Some rights which are
fundamental to our life are given a
special status. They are called
Fundamental Rights. We have
already read in Chapter 2 the
preamble to our Constitution. It
talks about securing for all its
citizens equality, liberty and justice.

Fundamental Rights put this
promise into effect. They are an
important basic feature of Indias
Constitution.

The Constitution says that the
government shall not deny to any
person in India equality before the law
or the equal protection of the laws. It
means that the laws apply in the same
manner to all, regardless of a persons
status. This is called the rule of law.

Rule of law is the foundation of any
democracy. It means that no person
is above the law. There cannot be any
distinction between a political leader,
government official and an ordinary
citizen.

Right to
Equality

Everyone knows
that the rich can
have better lawyers
in the courts. What
is the point in
talking about
equality before
law?

You already know our Constitution
provides for six Fundamental Rights.

Can you recall these? What exactly
do these rights mean for an ordinary
citizen? Let us look at these one by
one.

ã

Every citizen, from the Prime
Minister to a small farmer in a remote
village, is subjected to the same laws.

No person can legally claim any
special treatment or privilege just
because he or she happens to be an
important person. For example, a few
years ago a former Prime Minister of
the country faced a court case on
charges of cheating. The court finally
declared that he was not guilty. But
as long as the case continued, he had
to go to the court, give evidence and
file papers, just like any other citizen.

This basic position is further
clarified in the Constitution by
spelling out some implications of the
Right to Equality. The government
shall not discriminate against any
citizen on grounds only of religion,
race, caste, sex or place of birth. Every
citizen shall have access to public
places like shops, restaurants, hotels,
and cinema halls. Similarly, there
shall be no restriction with regard to
the use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats,
roads, playgrounds and places of
public resorts maintained by
government or dedicated to the use
of general public. This might appear
very obvious, but it was necessary to

Rationalised 2023-24 incorporate these rights in the
Constitution of our country where the
traditional caste system did not allow
people from some communities to
access all public places.

The same principle applies to
public jobs. All citizens have equality
of opportunity in matters relating to
employment or appointment to any
position in the government. No
citizen shall be discriminated
against or made ineligible for
employment on the grounds
mentioned above. You have read in

# Chapter 4 : that the Government of

India has provided reservations for
Scheduled Castes, Scheduled
Tribes and Other Backward Classes.

Various governments have different
schemes for giving preference to
women, poor or physically
handicapped in some kinds of jobs.

Are these reservations against the
right to equality? They are not. For
equality does not mean giving
everyone the same treatment, no
matter what they need. Equality
means giving everyone an equal
opportunity to achieve whatever one
is capable of. Sometimes it is
necessary to give special treatment
to someone in order to ensure equal
opportunity. This is what job
reservations do. Just to clarify this,
the Constitution says
that
reservations of this kind are not a
violation of the Right to Equality.

The principle of non-discrimination
extends to social life as well. The
Constitution mentions one extreme
form of social discrimination, the
practice of untouchability, and
clearly directs the government to put
an end to it. The practice of
untouchability has been forbidden
in any form. Untouchability here
does not only mean refusal to touch
people belonging to certain castes.

It refers to any belief or social

competitors start the race from the same line?

Which of these two would be an equal and fair

jobs.

Observe any big public building. Is there a ramp
for physically handicapped? Are there any other
facilities that make it possible for physically

ture on the building? Do these special provi-
sions go against the principle of equality?

practice which looks down upon
people on account of their birth with
certain caste labels. Such practice
denies them interaction with others
or access to public places as equal
citizens. So the Constitution made
untouchability a punishable offence.

Rationalised 2023-24 Many Forms of Untouchability

In 1999, P. Sainath wrote a series of newsreports
in The Hindu describing untouchability and caste
discrimination that was still being practiced
against Dalits or persons belonging to Scheduled
Castes. He travelled to various parts of the coun-
try and found that in many places:
Tea stalls kept two kinds of cups, one for Dalits

one for others;

Barbers refused to serve dalit clients;
Dalit students were made to sit separately in the
classroom or drink water from separate picher;
Dalit grooms were not allowed to ride a horse

in the wedding procession; and

Dalits were not allowed to use common
handpump or if they did, the handpump was
washed to purify it.

All these fall under the definition of untouchability.

Can you think of some examples from your own

You are free to do everything which

larger interests of the society.

Freedom of

and personality develop only when we
are able to freely communicate with
others. You may think differently
from others. Even if a hundred
people think in one way, you should
have the freedom to think differently
and express your views accordingly.

You may disagree with a policy of
government or activities of an
association. You are free to criticise
the government or the activities of

your
conversations with parents, friends
and relatives. You may publicise
your views through a pamphlet,
magazine or newspaper. You can do
it through paintings, poetry or

freedom to instigate violence against
others. You cannot use it to incite
people to rebel against government.

be peaceful. They should not lead
to public disorder or breach of peace
in society. Those who participate in
these activities and meetings should
not carry weapons with them.

Citizens also can form associations.

For example workers in a factory can
form a workers union to promote
their interests. Some people in a
town may come together to form an
association to campaign against
corruption or pollution.

As citizens we have the freedom to
travel to any part of the country.

We are free to reside and settle in any
part of the territory of India. Let us

of Assam wants to start a business
in Hyderabad. He may not have any
connection with that city, he may not
have even seen it ever. Yet as a citizen
of India he has the right to set up base
there. This right allows lakhs of
people to migrate from villages to
towns and from poorer regions of the
countries to prosperous regions and
big cities. The same freedom extends
to choice of occupations. No one can
force you to do or not to do a certain
job. Women cannot be told that some
kinds of occupations are not for them.

Once the right to liberty and equality
is granted, it follows that every
citizen has a right not to be
exploited. Yet the Constitution
makers thought is was necessary to
write down certain clear provisions
to prevent exploitation of the weaker
sections of the society.

The Constitution mentions three
specific evils and declares these
illegal. First, the Constitution
prohibits traffic in human beings.

Traffic here means selling and
buying of human beings, usually
women, for immoral purposes.

Second, our Constitution also
prohibits forced labour or begar in

any form. Begar is a practice where
the worker is forced to render service
to the master free of charge or at a
nominal remuneration. When this
practice takes place on a life-long
basis, it is called the practice of
bonded labour.

Finally, the Constitution also
prohibits child labour. No one can
employ a child below the age of
fourteen to work in any factory or
mine or in any other hazardous
work, such as railways and ports.

Using this as a basis many laws have
been made to prohibit children from
working in industries such as beedi
making, firecrackers and matches,
printing and dyeing.

On the basis of these news reports write a letter to the editor or a petition to a court highlighting the
violation of right against exploitation:

Right to freedom includes right to
freedom of religion as well. In this case
too, the Constitution makers were
very particular to state it clearly. You
have already read in Chapter 2 that
India is a secular state. Most people
in India, like anywhere else in the
world, follow different religions. Some
may not believe in any religion.

Secularism is based on the idea that
the state is concerned only with
relations among human beings, and
not with the relation between human
beings and God. A secular state is one
that does not establish any one
religion as official religion. Indian
secularism practices an attitude of a
principled and equal distance from
all religions. The state has to be
neutral and impartial in dealing with
all religions.

Every person has a right to
profess, practice and propagate
the religion he or she believes in.

Every religious group or sect is free
to manage its religious affairs. A
right to propagate ones religion,
however, does not mean that a
person has right to compel another
person to convert into his religion by
means of force, fraud, inducement or
allurement. Of course, a person is free
to change religion on his or her own
will. Freedom to practice religion
does not mean that a person can do
whatever he wants in the name of

religion. For example, one cannot
sacrifice animals or human beings
as offerings to supernatural forces
or gods. Religious practices which
treat women as inferior or those that
infringe womens freedom are not
allowed. For example, one cannot
force a widow to shave head or wear
white clothes.

A secular state is one that does not
confer any privilege or favour on any
particular religion. Nor does it pun-
ish or discriminate against people
on the basis of religion they follow.

Thus the government cannot com-
pel any person to pay any taxes for
the promotion or maintenance of
any particular religion or religious
institution. There shall be no
religious instruction in the govern-
ment educational institutions. In
educational institutions managed by
private bodies no person shall be
compelled to take part in any
religious instruction or to attend any
religious worship.

You might wonder why the
Constitution makers were so
particular in providing written
guarantees of the rights of the
minorities. Why are there no special
guarantees for the majority? Well, for
the simple reason that the working
of democracy gives power to the
majority. It is the language, culture
and religion of minorities that needs
special protection. Otherwise, they
may get neglected or undermined
under the impact of the language,
religion and culture of the majority.

That is why the Constitution speci-
fies the cultural and educational
rights of the minorities:
Any section of citizens with a
distinct language or culture have
a right to conserve it.

All minorities have the right to es-

Here minority does not mean only
religious minority at the national

level. In some places people speaking
a particular language are in majority;
people speaking a different language
are in a minority. For example,
Telugu speaking people form a
majority in Andhra Pradesh. But they
are a minority in the neighbouring
State of Karnataka. Sikhs constitute
a majority in Punjab. But they are a
minority in Rajasthan, Haryana and

Do you notice references to the National Human

on this page? These references reflect the growing
awareness of human rights and struggles for human
dignity. Many cases of human rights violations in
diverse fields, for instance, Gujarat riots, are being
brought to the public notice from across India.

Human rights organisations and the media often
criticise government agencies for not seriously
pursuing these cases or catching the culprits.

Someone had to intervene on behalf of the
victims. This is where the National Human Rights
Commission stepped in. This is an independent
commission set up by law in 1993. Like
judiciary, the Commission is independent of the
government. The Commission is appointed by the
President and includes retired judges, officers and
eminent citizens. Yet it does not have the burden of
deciding court cases. So it can focus on helping
the victims secure their human rights. These
include all the rights granted to the citizens by the
Constitution. For NHRC human rights also include
the rights mentioned in the UN sponsored
international treaties that India has signed.

The NHRC cannot by itself punish the guilty.

That is the responsibility of courts. The NHRC is
there to make independent and credible inquiry
into any case of violation of human rights. It also
inquires into any case of abetment of such
violation or negligence in controlling it by any
government officer and takes other general steps
to promote human rights in the country. The
Commission presents its findings and
recommendations to the government or intervene
in the court on behalf of the victims. It has wide
ranging powers to carry out its inquiry. Like any
court it can summon witnesses, question any
government official, demand any official paper,
visit any prison for inspection or send its own
team for on-the-spot inquiry.

address to complain against the violation of

of all rights, our Constitution and
law offers a wider range of rights.

Over the years the scope of rights
has expanded.

Sometimes it leads to expansion
in the legal rights that the citizen can
enjoy. From time to time, the courts
gave judgments to expand the scope
of rights. Certain rights like right to
to
freedom of press, right
information, and right to education
are derived from the Fundamental
Rights. Now school education has
become a right for Indian citizens.

The governments are responsible for
providing free and compulsory
education to all children up to the
age of 14 years. Parliament has
enacted a law giving the right to

information to the citizens. This Act
was made under the Fundamental
Right to freedom of thought and
expression. We have a right to seek
information from government
offices. Recently the Supreme Court
has expanded the meaning of the
right to life to include the right to
food. Also, rights are not limited only
to Fundamental Rights as
enumerated in the Constitution.

Constitution provides many more
rights, which may not be Fundamental
Rights. For example the right to
property is not a Fundamental Right
but it is a constitutional right. Right to
vote in elections is an important
constitutional right.

Sometimes the expansion takes
place in what is called human rights.

These are universal moral claims that
may or may not have been recognised
by law. In that sense these claims are
not rights going by the definition that
we presented earlier. With the
expansion of democracy all over the
world, there is greater pressure on
governments to accept these claims.

International Covenant on

Rights

This international covenant recognises many
rights that are not directly a par t of the
Fundamental Rights in the Indian Constitution.

This has not yet become an international treaty.

But human right activists all over the world see
this as a standard of human rights. These include:
right to work: opportunity to everyone to earn

livelihood by working

right to safe and healthy working conditions,
fair wages that can provide decent standard of
living for the workers and their families

right to adequate standard of living including

adequate food, clothing and housing
right to social security and insurance
right to health: medical care during illness,
special care for women during childbirth and
prevention of epidemics

right to education: free and compulsory primary
education, equal access to higher education.

Thus the scope of rights has been
expanding and new rights are
evolving over time. They are result
of struggle of the people. New rights
emerge as societies develop or as
new constitutions are made. The
Constitution of South Africa guarantees
its citizens several kinds of new rights:
Right to privacy, so that citizens
or their home cannot be searched,
their phones cannot be tapped,
their communication cannot be
opened.

Right to an environment that is not
harmful to their health or well-
being;

Right to have access to adequate

housing.

Right to have access to health care
services, sufficient food and water;
no one may be refused emergency
medical treatment.

Many people think that the right to
work, right to health, right to minimum
livelihood and right to privacy
should be made fundamental rights
in India as well. What do you think?

campaign for human rights. This organisation brings out independent

When Madhurima went to the property registration office, the
Registrar told her, You cant write your name as Madhurima Banerjee
do A. K. Banerjee. You are married, so you must give your husbands
name. Your husbands surname is Rao. So your name should be
changed to Madhurima Rao. She did not agree. She said If my
husbands name has not changed after marriage, why should mine?

In your opinion who is right in this dispute? And why?

Thousands of tribals and other forest dwellers gathered at Piparia in
Hoshangabad district in Madhya Pradesh to protest against their
proposed displacement from the Satpura National Park, Bori Wildlife
Sanctuary and Panchmarhi Wildlife Sanctuary. They argue that such
a displacement is an attack on their livelihood and beliefs. Government
claims that their displacement is essential for the development of
the area and for protection of wildlife. Write a petition on behalf of
the forest dwellers to the NHRC, a response from the government
and a report of the NHRC on this matter.

For example right to freedom of movement is connected to the freedom
of occupation. One reason for this is that freedom of movement enables
a person to go to place of work within ones village or city or to another
village, city or state. Similarly this right can be used for pilgrimage,
connected with freedom to follow ones religion. Draw a circle for
each right and mark arrows that show connection between or among
different rights. For each arrow, give an example that shows the
linkage.
